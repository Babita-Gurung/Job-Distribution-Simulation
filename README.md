# Job-Distribution-Simulation
●	Developed a program to simulate the movement of five jobs across five nodes in a row.
●	Implemented random time distribution based on a uniform 0-100 range for each job's stay in a node.
●	Checked the system every 500-time units to analyze the job distribution to even spread across the nodes.
●	Validated program functionality by outputting results for the first 15 clock changes, including current node and next node change time.
